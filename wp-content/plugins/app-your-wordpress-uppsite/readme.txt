= Why we do this? =

We at UppSite believe that any web publisher and content creator deserves the best mobile presence. 

Mobile has significantly changed how people consume content these days. More and more we attempt to access and consume content from our smart mobile devices. However, mobile is a new form factor and users expect to enjoy seamless experiences extending the functionality and UI design that is characteristic to their devices. Shrinking websites to fit a mobile screen is simply not enough. In the mobile era publishers and content creators should, so we believe, engage with their audiences in a mobile way. 

True, going mobile is normally a tedious task that requires tens of thousand of dollars, months of development work and dealings with many outlets and providers to get your app out on the market. Gladly, this is not the case with UppSite. We’ve set out to bridge the mobile gap for all publishers by providing a dead-simple and fast solution to turn a site into a mobile application, without compromising the quality of the end result. From creation to publication we make this process as easy as it gets, and as affordable as you could only imagine. Our apps (native & webapp), although created in less than two minutes deliver all the features and functionality that you’d expect from the most cutting-edge apps out there, and cater to the needs of publishers of all sizes.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

<h3>General</h3>

= What is UppSite? =

Our platform is 100% automatic, requires zero technical skills and will turn your site into an app in a matter of minutes. UppSite makes no changes to the desktop version of your site, and allows you to keep operating your site and updating your content as usual. Additionally, UppSite provides publishers with tools to better engage and retain their audience on mobile devices, as well as monetize their content via mobile advertising networks. 

= Can I make money from my app? =
Yes, all of our users have the ability to make some profit from their applications. Our applications come with a built-in Ads system and users with a basic plan get ad revenues. More advanced plans allow users to integrate their apps with their own ad-networks.

<h3>Registration and setting-up</h3>

= How do I create an UppSite application? =
Creating an application is as easy as 1-2-3! Simply type-in your website’s URL address on UppSite’s homepage, and we’ll guide you through an extremely short and easy process that will turn your website into a mobile application in less than 2 minutes.

<h3>Customization</h3>

= Can I choose my application's <em>splash screen, title or icon</em>? =
Yes! After creating your application you can change your app's splash screen, title and icon. You can use our editor or upload images of your own. These images can be changed from your Dashboard at any time.

= Can I customize the way my app looks like? =
All of our users have the ability to customize their application. You can change your app's background and display layout. Stay tuned as we will soon release a variety of custom themes that will allow you to entirely change the look & feel of your app. 

= When will these changes take place? =
Changes made to your website's design will immediately be reflected in your app on the UppSites Portal. On native Android & iOS apps changes will take place on the next version release. A minor version release cycle is usually 2-4 weeks.

= Can I change my app's name? =
Yes! As long as this name is not being used by any other app on our service, you can change your app's name on the UppSites Portal app.

Please note that if you already have a native app with our service, then the name of your app cannot be changed again as stipulated by the terms and conditions governing Apple’s App Store, Google Play and Windows Marketplace.

<h3>Publishing</h3>

= How much does it cost to create a WebApp and publish my native application on the various stores? =
Creating a mobile web application and publishing your app on the UppSites Portal app is completely free of charge! Creating a native app with UppSite is also free to anyone with a valid developer account with Google Play, Windows Phone and/or Apple’s iOS.

= How do I upload my application to a store? =
You don't. We do it for you! All our users are automatically published on the UppSites Portal app. If you have a valid developer account with Google Play, Windows Phone and/or Apple’s iOS, you can opt to submit your apps to the respective stores. All you need to do is simply update your dev account details on our secured dashboard and we'll take it from there!

= Why do I need applications for various devices? =
Different mobile devices run on different operating systems, that's why a different application is required for each operating system. Apple's iPhone and iPad run on iOS, while many Samsung, HTC, LG and Motorola devices run on Android. In order to reach a large audience, applications must be created for a wide range of devices and, therefore, for different operating systems.

= How soon will my native app be available for download? =
After we’ve created your app it will be published on the UppSites Portal app immediately.
In case you’ve entered valid credentials for your Google Android Developer account, Windows Phone Developer account, or iOS Developer account, your app will be submitted to the relevant stores in 1-3 days after approval. Following submission, publication is subject to the stores' processing time, which in most cases is as follows:

* Google Play: Up to 48 hours.
* Apple App Store: 2-14 business days (sadly, it does not depend on us).

We will notify you via email promptly after your app has been approved and is available in each store.
